# UFC Pick Archive 

## Overview

**UFC Pick Archive** (name tentative) is a website created by a huge UFC fan who spends far too much time watching UFC podcasts. Through being a fan I always thought 
there should be a resource that lists the picks each social media influencer / pundit / analyst make on upcoming fights, listing their percentage of correctness and pick history. 

Site name ideas: UFCPickArchive.com, OctagonPicks.com, MMAInfluencerPicks.com, UFCInfluencerPicks.com, SocialUFCPicks.com, UFCInfluencerInsights.com
